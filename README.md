A BPM-based automatic keyboard piano simulator built with Python.

This tool is designed to simulate keypresses on virtual piano websites or browser-based rhythm games. It does not produce any sound, only simulates key presses based on given note sheets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- ‚å®Ô∏è Automatically presses keys according to written notes
- üéµ BPM and speed correction support for accurate timing
- üéÆ Compatible with virtual piano sites and browser games
- üí§ Can be used as an **AFK bot** for online games
- üí° Shift support for capital letters and symbols

## üîç Example Uses

- **Playing songs** on [virtualpiano.net](https://virtualpiano.net/) and similar sites
- **On Roblox piano games
- **Bypassing AFK detection** in games (use input like `w|||||||w`)
- **Simulating keyboard macros** for testing or automation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

- **BPM (Beats Per Minute)**: Controls note speed.
- **Speed Correction**: Fine-tunes the tempo. If notes play too fast or too slow:
  - Increase towards `1` to **slow down**
  - Decrease towards `0` to **speed up**
  - Example: `0.35` works well for most songs.

### AFK Bot Settings

To use this as an AFK bot:
BPM: 10
Speed Correction: 1
Note Sheet: w|||||||w

This simulates pressing `w`, waiting a bit, and pressing again‚Äîcommonly used to bypass AFK warnings.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

1. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python keyboard_simulator.py
    ```

2. Paste or type your note sheet.

3. Adjust BPM and speed correction.

4. Press `‚ñ∂ Start` or `F8` to begin playback.

5. Press `‚ñ† Stop` or `F8` again to stop.

## üìå Notes Syntax

- Single note: `a b c D E`
- Chords (multiple keys): `[asd] [ASD]`
- Delay/pause: `|` or `-`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This software only simulates keyboard input. It is intended for educational and entertainment purposes. Misuse of automated input tools in online games may violate terms of service.
